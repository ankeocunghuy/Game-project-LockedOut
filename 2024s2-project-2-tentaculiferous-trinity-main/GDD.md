# Milestone 2: Game Design Document
Team: Tentaculiferous Trinity

Game Name: LockedOut 

Workshop: Monday 9:00-11:00

Theme: Eerie Worlds  - Unease, Fascination with a spooky or surreal atmosphere. Gameplay mechanics that are bizarre, yet captivating.

## Game Overview
### **Core Concept**

The core concept of the game is to immerse players in _surreal, dream-like world_ where they confront the anxieties and challenges of graduating university and searching for a job. The job interview and the associated stress has been translated into a series of puzzles and encounters. The player takes on the role of a recent graduate navigating this dream world, overcoming symbolic challenges such as creating the perfect resume or passing a daunting video interview.

### **Related Genre(s)/Games**

The game falls into a mix of narrative-driven adventure while incorporating puzzle elements with some basic platforming as well. Similiar games would include _Silent Hill_ for its eerie atmosphere and psychological elements.

Additionally  Like _It Takes Two_, our game offers a dynamic experience where players encounter diverse challenges that require them to think creatively and adapt to different scenarios. It also uses a similar small person in a big world perspective, although ours will be first person.

Elements of the server room levels will take inspiration from: _Fireboy & Watergirl_ in the multitasking/teamwork level, as the player must control two characters;

_Only Up_ in the coding language themed level.


### **Target Audience**
_Who is your game aimed at?_

The game is primarily aimed at university students who are nearing the end of their degrees and facing the pressure of entering the job market. It also targets recent graduates who might resonate with the game's themes of anxiety, self-doubt, and the challenges of finding a job. Both of these groups would be familiar with the struggle of job applications and likely to appreciate the game's blend of various elements. 


### **Unique Selling Points (USPs)**
The game's unique selling point lies in its ability to subvert player expectations through a variety of puzzles that blend surreal deam logic with the real life application process.  The game's narrative and mechanics are deeply intertwined, offering an experience that is both reflective and challenging. Bosses in the game aren't combative but represent different facets of the job application process, turning familiar, mundane tasks into epic, dream-like confrontations. Additionally, the use of non-traditional visual and audio cues, sets the game apart from others. 


## Story and Narrative
### **Backstory**
Our unnamed protagonist stands on the precipice of graduation, having conquered three grueling years of assignments and exams. The air buzzes with anticipation as the ceremony unfolds‚Äîa moment of triumph and uncertainty. But wait! Something is amiss. The crowd freezes, expressions etched in odd patterns. Time itself seems to hesitate, caught in a glitch. Our protagonist senses the anomaly, a rift between reality and... something else. 

And then it happens‚Äîthe dream state. A surreal shift, where the rules bend and twist. Together, we venture into this enigmatic realm, facing treacherous obstacles. Each challenge tests our wit, courage, and resolve. Everday tasks have been enlarged, dominating our vision and making us feel small and insignificant. Why should we traverse and perserve to defeat these "bosses"? Because at the end of this path lies **the ultimate prize**: a coveted job. Join us as we unravel secrets, battle the inexplicable, and chase the elusive dream job. üåô‚ú®

_ is an unremarkable student‚Äîno grand achievements, no dazzling talents. They blend into the lecture halls, scribbling notes, fueled by a diet of instant noodles and energy drinks. But beneath the surface, a quiet storm brews. The looming specter of post-graduation job hunting haunts _‚Äôs nights. The r√©sum√©, the interviews; Their pulse races at the thought.



### The Clerk

</div>

In the hallowed halls of job applications, where r√©sum√©s meet their fate, there exists a mysterious figure‚Äîthe Clerk. Unbeknownst to most, this clerk is no ordinary gatekeeper. It harbors a secret: it‚Äôs an AI, a digital oracle that scans r√©sum√©s with ruthless precision. The Clerk‚Äôs mission? To separate the wheat from the chaff, the standout r√©sum√©s from the mundane. It thrives on keywords, formatting, and subtle cues.

To secure an interview, you must craft a r√©sum√© that dances on the edge of human and machine. Blend eloquence with data, weave accomplishments into a compelling narrative, and sprinkle just enough industry jargon.

For example in stage 3 we will use the programming language theme and have to jump from the bottom to the top of the room and exit through the door at the top of the room. After completing this server, the resume will unlock programming skills.

## Characters Beyond Scope
Possible characters that we would like to include, but can't without sacrificing quality of the scenes we will be implementing. Further explained in progression. 

### Attention to Detail Server

Our original plan contained 4 servers, but once we started the project, we realized we needed someone to do all the miscellaneous work with shaders, particle systems, loading screens, 3D models, animations, etc. This led us to make the choice to not include Server 4, which was planned to be the attention to detail level. We didn't think this took away much from the level regardless as it was likely our weakest level relating to the story, and could take much longer than the other levels.

### The Swarm 

<div align="center">
  <img src="https://media1.tenor.com/m/EgUmYCPH8REAAAAC/flying-keys-hogwarts-magic-keys-flying-bug.gif" alt="It Takes Two GIF">
</div>

The Swarm isn‚Äôt your typical entity‚Äîit‚Äôs a collective force, a pulsating network of hundreds of job applications. It thrives on ambition and purpose. Each application represents a dream, a chance at the perfect job. The Swarm navigates the digital landscape, seeking that elusive match‚Äîa fusion of skills, passion, and destiny. Your mission? To find the one application that unlocks a future brimming with possibility. 

Inspired by the scene from Harry Potter: The Philosopher's Stone in which Harry must find the correct key amongst a swarm of false keys.

### The Camera

</div>


In the dimly lit chamber of video interviews, where pixels hold your fate, there exists an enigmatic entity _The Camera_. But this isn't your usual camera! It‚Äôs personified, a whisperer of self-doubt. As you gaze into its glassy eye, it scrutinizes your every word, every nervous tic. The Player and the Camera dance a foxtrot, moving forward and backward with the camera always questioning you. It nudges you to rerecord, replay, and second-guess. ‚ÄúYour lighting,‚Äù it murmurs, ‚Äúcould be better.‚Äù ‚ÄúDid you stumble there?‚Äù it questions. And so you record, delete, repeat‚Äîa dance of anxiety.
 
_Time ticks away, deadlines loom. Will you yield to doubt or defy it?_


### The Robot 

<div align="center">

</div>

You've made it through all the challenges and only one remains, the in person interview... for a computer science major, this can represent the most significant challeenge, being sociable. You arrive in the level and can see your body sitting across from your potential new boss, but something is amiss. The color is absent from the scene, your face is locked in a emotionless expression, your movements are robotic, and your personality has vanished. You must enter into your brain and find those missing components of humor, heart, emotions, personality, and plug them back into your brain. As you do, color returns to the world, and you make a good impression on your boss. This reinforces the overall theme of the game that encourages you to be yourself.

## Gameplay and Mechanics

### _Progression_

Initially the plan was to have four stages with cutscenes in between. As mentioned in the backstory, the game would start with the player walking up to receive their degree. There'd be a flash to black with the player in the Swarm Room, trying to find the golden job to get through to the application process. Then the player would progress 'defeating' each boss and getting closer to securing a job. The diagram below highlights the plan with regard to the stages: 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/30f0881f-3a04-45fe-8d5f-297233d60acc)

This was the plan that the team initially came up with. However, with regards to the time limit and the [Ed Discussion post](https://edstem.org/au/courses/17177/discussion/2150551) the levels and the game was changed slightly. This resulted in the game design being:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/db8101f6-02a7-485e-a1fd-61af64380546)

The reason that the team decided to specifically focus on this boss and this level was due to a variety of reasons. The initial plan had 4 bosses with the linking between them not as clear, with scenes between bosses not fleshed out and consiting of fading to black and loading the new scene. The inherent concept of the Clerk is more reminiscent of the current job market with AI being in charge of applications. Furthermore, the reveal of the clerk being an AI was an idea that we wanted the player to find out and discover for themselves. This could be in the form of little notes left around the level, giving some clues.  

Through having one level with 4 mini levels, this means that the server room can have a higher level of detail. The mini levels also add more in a narrative sense. Each mini level corresponds to a skill typically found on a resume (Logic, Multitasking, Coding, and Attention To Detail). Thus completing each mini level suplements the player's resume and makes them a more attractive candidate. Each mini level would have their own unique fail conditions. Logic would be represented by a quiz, Multitasking as controlling two players to achieve a goal, Coding as a platformer, and Attention to Detail as a puzzle game. 

For instance, with the coding platformer, the goal would be to get to the top, missing a step or falling down restarting the player back at the start. The platformer section is meant to represent a programmer's journey learning basic concepts and then using them to get further and improve their skills. The fall back to the start is to represent the amount of effort you can put into a program only to have a small mistake (typo, logical error, etc), a bug, force you to comb through your entire code adn essentially retart the process. However, on the second go around, you'll have all the previous knowledge.

</div>


### _Player Perspective_

The player's perspective would be mainly first-person. First-person as camera perspective inherently feels eerie with the only information only available through the player's control. Adding to the amount of eerieness would be the lack of hands or any body, The player has to control themselves solely relying on their skill and judgement. This absence of a fixed visual representation allows players to project themselves onto the narrative canvas, fostering a deeper sense of immersion.

Exceptions to this may occur within the mini levels of the servers, as with the level involving multitasking it will switch to a 2D platformer with third person perspective

### _Controls_ 

The player has to navigate the dreamscape using the WASD keys as movement and using the mouse in order to look around and observe the environment. Jumping will be implemented with space. The gravity will be less than what would be normal, as we want to give the game an eerie dream feeling of floating. 

_Special Controls_ inside the different levels. The riddles will provide an option to click an option although no hand will protrude to click it. The multitasking level will allow the player to control a second character with the arrow keys, and W and up arrow will be used to jump.


### _Scoring System_ 

Upon first entering the server room, the player would have an empty resume with just the details of their name and their graduation recorded. Through completing each mini level, the resume would be updated with the corresponding skill. A possible idea would be letting players look at their resumes and reading it. However, this might not add anything to the game and could be a hinderance in certain sections. Having the resume beind upated would  help reinforce that the player is going in the right direction. This is necessary as due to the inherent genre of the puzzle genre, the game might seem confusing and might not make sense. The difference between eerie and off-putting and just confusing is a fine line. 


### _Gameplay Mechanics_

The initial 'stage' of walking up and graduating university would serve to introduce the player to the game and the controls. There would be a variety of gameplay mechanics, with the server room and the graduation having basic movement controls, Then each mini level woiuld slightly challenge the convention with new concepts. The actions and the choice of levels is largely player controlled, as they determine what skill they want to improve on first. The core mechanic that would make the game fun would be the constant switch up and the changing of levels. This would force players to be on the top of their game, adapting to the challenges. Additionally, the transformation and the subversion of the resume process would be eerie and offputting to the player. This is supplemented by the boss being AI, having your entire future and career prospects being determined by a computer definitely adds to the overarching theme. 


## Levels and World Design

### Game World
The Game World is currently represented as two main stages with 4 additional mini-levels. The player has the graduation ceremony, enters the server room, completes the challenges, and beats the clerk. The game world is captured on-screen through the player's eyes and how they choose to navigate the scene in front of them. The main perspective for the world would be 3D, however during the multitasking mini level, the game would change to be represented as 2D similiar to _FireBoy and WaterGirl_. Since the player's options would be generally limited in the server room, there would be no need for a minimap. The use of a map was proposed during the Attention To Detail/Exit 8 level, but this would simply would allow the players to see when the level would end. 


### Objects

One important object in the game world would be your 'classmates' who are applauding you as you receive your degree, initial designs was to have them be human-like but something off-putting. This was changed instead to have classmates with caps and robes, but they haver only a large eerie smile on their face. Just being surronded by everyone sitting down as the player has to walk up and receive their degree would already be unsettling. In the server room, as the name suggest the main objects would the servers each containing the skills that the player has to improve on. There would also be the desk with the resumes appearing and getting rejected by the Clerk. Also regarding the clerk, the goal isn't to fight or kill it. Similiar to how you shouldn't kill a recruiter, instead impressing them with your resume. 

### Physics

The game physics would largely represent the real world, with a slight sluggish nature to show that everything isn't all right and there's something off. In the platformer, there would be a slight change to allow more fluid movement, and having the player slowly float down. This works to help the player and ensure that the mini levels should not be too hard or too restricting for them. 

## Art and Audio

Art Style: What is the art style of the game? What does the game look like? What are the colours, shapes, and textures used? What is the overall aesthetic? Concept art and/or references to games with similar art styles might be helpful here.

The art style draws inspiration from _Dredge_, with a visually captivating and immersive experience. _Low Poly_ aesthetics for characters and bosses creating a unique blend of simplicity and abstraction. 

<p align="center">

</p>


_Colour_: The colour palette would balance mute tones with occasional vibrant accents. In the Server Room, the colour sceheme would be largely industrial with different shades of grey. This would heavily contrast with the mini levels would be vibrant with earthy colours (browns, green and blue) can help to evoke dreamlike and real-world elements. In the opening scene, it would again be full of dreary and gray color schemes, set on a cloudy day in a field.

_Shapes_: Geometric shapes dominate with triangles, sqaures, and hexagons. This would be easier to code and render due to the shape language of the characters and the objects. Furthermore, the use of subtle textures such as gradients and noise can help to add depth. 

_Overall Aesthetic_: The overall aesthetic should evoke a sense of **dissonance**, the familiar twisted into something otherwordly. Everyday objects take on monumental proportions emphasizing their significance. The tension is created with the juxtaposistion between dream logic and real-world elements. 

_Sound and Music_: Ambient noises can be used to enhance the surreal atmosphere. In the server room, the noise would be dominated by the repeated slam of resumes being rejected, further emphasising the clerk's power and control. While not fully visualised, the concept of using somne glitchy noises to subtley suggest that the visualization is a dream could be a potnetial idea. 

Another idea that the team had was distorting the ringing of an alarm clock so that it sounds weird and offputting but still slightly recognisable. This could potentially be applied in the mini levels. 

_Character Models_: Low Poly Models would be used throughout the game, constrasted by some elements such as the servers to really emphasise the contrast between the themes. The assets for the server room would be mainly everday objects blown up to represent their larger scale, The mini levels would be more specific and would need to incorporate their associated skill to emphasise the improvement of the skill. In terms of references for assets, looking online to see any royalty free libraries would be an option. Additionally, games such as Monument Valley and Dredge would serve as artistic starting points.

</p>


## User Interface (UI)

The User Interface would be quite barren, with just the resume appearing in the server room on the top right. This is to encoruage the player to look around more for clues and pay attention to the overall detail of certain sections. There was an idea of having the notes the player collected folow them around and allowing them to quickly reference then when needed. However, it might clutter the player experience and lessen from player experience

</div>


## Technology and Tools

The software used for the game would be Unity and GitHub as per the specifications and additionally the use of Discord and Trello for project management. At present, we haven‚Äôt identified a need for additional tools. However, we remain open to adjustments as the project scope evolves.

## Team Communication, Timelines and Task Assignment

Team communication would be broken down into two parts, in-person and online. Brief informal discussions would be held before and after the Monday tutorials as this is when all team members would be present physically. Secondary meetings will be held on Wednesday from 11:30-2:30 with the inherent purpose of working together and covering concepts that might need more time. 

Online communication would be facilitated through a Discord group chat, with the possibility and ability to have group calls when team members are not in the same place. Furthermore, a Trello board has been created to outline the tasks and to properly manage delegation and for progress tracking.

## Possible Challenges

The inherent scope of the game might be a lot more than what might be expected. There might need to be cuts or changes and adjustments to the overall layout of the game and the associated length. With reference from Ed, the scope should be kept reasonable and not too ambitious: 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5c107a8e-d3bd-4645-bab0-427cc1d89ef9)


Furthermore, most of the team has had no experience with 3D modelling and creation of assets. This might mean members would need to spend more time honing and improving these skills. Constant prototyping and testing throughout the project to understand the scope and overall flow of the game can be very helpful. Otherwise certain details might be lost in the process.
