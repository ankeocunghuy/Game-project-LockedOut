Our university team has crafted an unsettling yet captivating game that transports players to a surreal, dream-like realm, designed to reflect the disorienting journey of life after graduation. In this game, players step into the shoes of a recent graduate, navigating an ever-shifting landscape filled with symbolic obstacles and unsettling encounters that mirror the anxiety and uncertainty of job searching. From the meticulous challenge of crafting the ultimate resume to facing off against the suffocating pressure of an impossible video interview, each moment is an allegory of real-world struggles. The gameâ€™s eerie atmosphere, rich with unexpected twists and immersive puzzles, invites players to confront their fears and resilience in a world where the lines between reality and dream blur and the stakes feel impossibly high.
